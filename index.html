                        <p>Born on January 7, 1985, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England, Lewis Hamilton showed a keen interest in racing from a very young age. His father, Anthony Hamilton, supported his passion by buying him a go-kart at the age of eight. By age ten, Hamilton was already winning national karting championships.</p>
                        <p>He progressed through the ranks, winning multiple karting titles before joining the McLaren Young Driver Support Programme in 1998. His talent and determination quickly caught the eye of motorsport professionals, paving the way for his entry into Formula Renault and later, Formula 3.</p>
                        <p>In 2007, Hamilton made his Formula 1 debut with McLaren and stunned the world by finishing third in his first race and narrowly missing the championship by just one point in his rookie season.</p>
